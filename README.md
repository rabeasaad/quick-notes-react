# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

### @vitejs/plugin-react
Uses Babel (or oxc when used in rollup-vite) for Fast Refresh  
[Plugin link](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)

### @vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Uses SWC for Fast Refresh
