# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react
Uses Babel (or oxc when used in rollup-vite) for Fast Refresh
Plugin link

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on development & build performance.
To add it, see React Compiler Documentation
.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production applications, it is recommended to use TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
Check out the TS template
 for information on how to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint
 in your project.
